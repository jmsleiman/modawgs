Fire up the server located in ./server/main.py. From there, it will ask you where the outputs of FIMO, Seed, and DREME are located (XML formats only), and where the original FASTA files are located.

After that, your data can be analysed on port 8000 via any WebSocket compliant web browser. The default viewer is located in ./viewer/index.html . It was tested extensively with versions of Chrome, Chromium, and Firefox released after mid-2014.

Any browser that can run D3.js should be able to run the viewer. Each tab opens up a new View Model, so you can play with your results to get different interpretations.

Future revisions might have an option to precalculate a compatibility matrix -- at the moment, compatibility is handled on-demand, which isn't ideal.
